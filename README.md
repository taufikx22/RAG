# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System from Scratch

A fully modular, production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built from the ground up. This project demonstrates end-to-end capabilities from document parsing, chunking, vector search, context-aware generation, evaluation, and API deployment.

# WORK UNDER PROGRESS

<!--
## Features

- Multi-format document ingestion (PDF, DOCX, HTML)
- Modular chunking (fixed, semantic, recursive)
- Pluggable embedding generators (OpenAI, Gemini)
- Vector DB support (ChromaDB, Qdrant)
- Retrieval strategies (semantic, hybrid, reranking)
- Prompt-based LLM generation (OpenAI or local LLaMA)
- Evaluation framework (accuracy, latency, hallucination)
- FastAPI backend
